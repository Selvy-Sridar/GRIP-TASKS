Hello! Here, I've shared my task 1 and task 2 that has been assigned to me as a Data Science intern at The Sparks Foundation.

Task 1 is about Prediction using Supervised ML.It involves a simple linear regression using 2 variables. Here, I've to predict the score of a student based on the no of hours studied. The given Dataset can be found at http://bit.ly/w-data

Task 2 is about Prediction using Unsupervised ML. Here I've to cluster the given Iris Dataset. I've used the Elbow method to find the optimal number of clusters. The Iris Dataset can be found at https://bit.ly/3kXTdox
